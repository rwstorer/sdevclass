## Routing and Switching

This module will not provide a "deep dive" into routing or switching--other, dedicated, courses do that. This module will give you a brief introduction to routing and switching. To familiarize yourself with some routing and switching basics, please read [What is Routing and Switching?](https://www.secur.cc/what-is-routing-and-switching/). Some takeaways:

- Hubs are a broadcast domain
- Switches operate at layer two in the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model)
  - Some switches also perform routing at layer three--we commonly refer to them as `layer 3 switches`
  - Some switches provide a web-GUI or a CLI management interface and we refer to them as `managed switches`
    - Managed switches allow administrators to configure individual ports for VLANs, port mirroring, etc., for example {{< myimg "/images/tplink-ts-sg108e.webp" "tplink-ts-sg108e" >}}
    - Unmanaged switches (sometimes called `dumb switches`) do not, typically, provide a web-GUI or a CLI
