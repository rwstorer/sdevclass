## Introduction

Hybrid Systems covers the fundamentals of building a hybrid on-premises and
cloud-based IT infrastructure. The course is designed to teach students how
to optimize a hybrid IT infrastructure for security, cost, fault tolerance,
and high availability. Students will explore course topics through a guided,
hands-on approach.

## Learning Objectives

1. Create a local network
2. Explain and implement IPv4 and IPv6
3. Explain and implement cloud-based DNS
4. Discuss routing fundamentals
5. Discuss switching fundamentals
6. Implement Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) endpoints and VPC peering
7. Design and implement a Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) solution
8. Configure and manage Identity Management in a hybrid infrastructure
9. Configure and access storage in a hybrid infrastructure
10. Configure and access a database in a hybrid infrastructure
11. Explain security issues when implementing a hybrid network solution
